      <p>Categorically, Non-Sporting dogs are mostly comprised
      of breeds that are difficult to incorporate into the other
      six groups. As a result, these dogs vary in size, ability,
      appearance, and personality. It’s hard to see how
      American Eskimo Dogs, Dalmations, Poodles, and
      French Bulldogs can be in the same category, but it’s
      simply because they are too interesting to put into words!
