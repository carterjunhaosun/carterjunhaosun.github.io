## About

This was a web development side project I completed in mid 2020. It includes elements of HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to make an interactive and informative site for descriptions and examples of the main types of dogs.

1. From the index page, you can click on the type of dog you'd like to learn more about. 
2. Upon clicking a dog from the index page, you can read about that type of dog. You can also click on the dog below the descriptive text to see it do a little animation.
3. The website wasn't made for all device resolutions, so it's likely that the website looks odd. This feature wasn't a priority for me when learning web development at the time - I was more so interested in making a product using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and learning the fundamentals of these languages.
