      <p>A relatively new category, herding dogs used
        to belong to the Working group.
        Herding dogs have historically been used to
        help farms manage their livestock, which is no easy
        task. Just watch any video of a herding dog in
        action - this kind of work requires real skill!
        Examples of herding dogs are
        Australian Cattle Dog, Australian Shepherds,
        Border Collies, and Old English Sheepdogs,
        among others.  These dogs need  lots
        of space to run around and exercise,
        but they are extremely intelligent
        and very rewarding to train!
