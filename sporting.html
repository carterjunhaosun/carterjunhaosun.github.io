      <p>As the name implies, sporting dogs are traditionally used
        to fetch sport - hunters would bring these dogs along
        with them while hunting.  They have great instincts, and
        their senses make them great for important jobs such as
        tracking. Due to their very active nature, these dogs
        require a ton of exercise, so make sure to bring them
        jogging!  Some dog breeds in this group include
        Brittanys, English Setters, Golden Retrievers, and Pointers.
