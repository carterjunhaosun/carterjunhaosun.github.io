      <p>Due to their strong sense of smell, hounds are often used for their
        tracking abilities. On top of that, their powerful stamina and wide
        range of vision make them extra adapted for their role as dog detectives.
        Some examples of hound breeds include the Beagle, Basset Hound,
        Greyhound, and the Norwegian Elkhound.
